Welcome to my study repository! 👋

This project documents my development path in Data Science and Machine Learning. Here you will find my exercise solutions, notes, and code implementations based on the book by **Aurélien Géron: "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow" (3rd Edition)**.


## 🛠️ Tech Stack
I use a standard Data Science stack for this project:
* **Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** Scikit-Learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
* **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Progress Log
I update my progress as I move through the chapters.
